# RC-application

It is a responsive **webpage** I did when applying for a job some time ago.

If you want to run it in your local machine, pull the code, run `npm install` and then `npm run start`.

The **Next** button doesn't take you anywhere. It just changes its styling if the form has been fulfilled successfully.
